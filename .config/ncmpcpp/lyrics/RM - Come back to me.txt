I told you I'm fine tonight
Staying good
Spring always been here
I will sleep in her eyes
Come back to me
Like you used to do
Be what you be
I will roll you to moon

I forgot the hour
I don't wanna know 'bout the hour
I forgot to shower
세수할 시간도 아까워
["Sesuhal sigando akkawo" / "It's a waste of time to wash my face"]
You don't have to be
You don't have to be the anything you see
Tryin' not to be
Tryin' not to be that something in this sea

Come back to me
Like you used to
Now I could see what a life is about
I told you I'm fine tonight
Staying good
Spring always been here
I will sleep in her eyes

Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
I see you come back to me
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
I see you come back to me

You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
Get, get, get to the
Divine, divine, so fine
I see you come back to me

I forgot the hour
I don't wanna know 'bout the hour
I forgot to shower
세수할 시간도 아까워
["Sesuhal sigando akkawo" / "It's a waste of time to wash my face"]
You don't have to be
You don't have to be the anything you see
Tryin' not to be
Tryin' not to be that something in this sea

I told you I'm fine tonight
Staying good
Spring always been here
I will sleep in her eyes

Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
I see you come back to me
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
I see you come back to me

You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
Get, get, get to the
Divine, divine, so fine
I see you come back to me

You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine
You are my pain, divine, divine...
